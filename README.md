# OpenCell_API_download
Example script for downloading data from OpenCell using the API

Take not that there is a size limit for downloading data (refer to the OPenCell WIki https://wiki.opencellid.org/wiki/API)
For large geographical areas you might need to divide your boundaries into smaller chunks to stay within the limit.
